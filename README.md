New parents often find themselves asking how long their baby has been sleeping, or when their last nap was, or maybe when they ate last or how long they nursed. In the first few weeks or whenever the baby becomes ill, the nurse or doctor will probably inquire how many dirty diapers the baby has had in the past 24 hours. Baby Logs is an [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E) skill built to help all parents track each of these events. Baby logs will track when and how long a baby eats or sleeps, as well as track and report the number of dirty diapers recorded in the past 24 hours.
